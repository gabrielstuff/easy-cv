We create electronically devices and computer software for ad agencies, young other startups looking for innovation, artists looking for new interaction with their audience and architects. We love to start a project from the beginning to deeply understand the client issue and find the best way to solve it. Each issue got its own solution and its preferred language or framework. We do not stick to one language, even if I personally prefer C++ and Javascript.   Since 2009, I teach processing at University UPMC to undergraduate students. I also give some course at l'Ecole Nationale Supérieure de Créations industrielles (ENSCI) about prototyping with Arduino. Finnaly since 2011, I give a full course about web development and application creation at le CELSA. This give little hints about what kind of issue we, software engineer, face everyday.",
